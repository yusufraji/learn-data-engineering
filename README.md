# learn-data-engineering

This repository contains my notes, and other reference materials used for my
data engineering learning journey.
I will begin with the [data engineering
zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp), and maybe
in the future, branch out to other materials, videos, and books.
